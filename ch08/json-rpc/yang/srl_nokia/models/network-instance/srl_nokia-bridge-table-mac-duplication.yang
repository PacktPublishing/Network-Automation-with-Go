             will be brought oper-down, with oper-down-reason mac-dup-detected. The duplicate macs on the interface will be kept
             in CPM though, and shown in the duplicate-entries state. In this case, arriving frames on a different subinterface with 
             the duplicate mac as source mac are dropped. Arriving frames on a different subinterface with a destination mac 
             matching the duplicate mac are dropped.

             frame received on this or any other subinterface with source mac matching a blackhole mac will be discarded. Any frame
             received with destination mac matching the blackhole mac will be discarded, although still processed for source mac
             learning.
           - stop-learning: upon detecting a duplicate mac on the subinterface, existing macs are kept (and refreshed) but new macs
             are no longer learned on this subinterface. The duplicate mac will stay learned on the subinterface. Frames arriving to
             a different subinterface with a source mac matching the duplicate mac will be dropped. Frames arriving to a different
             subinterface with a destination mac matching the duplicate mac will be forwarded normally.";
